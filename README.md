A. Unity — Project Structure Best Practices
=============

Employing an organized project structure is beneficial to your project and your team.

Scope:
* Folder Structure
* Folder Naming
* File Naming

Benefits:

* Consistency — The project structure has consistency in presentation regardless of team location, spoken language, or individual programmers.
* Maintenance — Consistent project structure will aid readability. Readability helps new and existing programmers revisit the code base for fixes and improvements.
* Communication — Developers more implicitly understand each other in written and verbal communication.

B. Coding Standards
=============

Coding standards define a programming style. 

See the repo's <a href="https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/unity-project-template/tree/master/Unity/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/RMC/Templates">C# Templates</a> for more info.

Employing organized coding standards is beneficial to your project and your team.

Scope:
